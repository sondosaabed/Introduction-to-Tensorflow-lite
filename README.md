# Introduction-to-Tensorflow-lite
This course was developed by the TensorFlow team and Udacity as a practical approach to model deployment for software developers.

## Overview

Learned how to deploy deep learning models on mobile and embedded devices with TensorFlow Lite.  Got hands-on experience with the TensorFlow Lite framework as I deployed deep learning models on Android, iOS, and even an embedded Linux platform. By the end of this course, I had all the skills necessary to start deploying my own deep learning model into my apps.
